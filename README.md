# About
ðŸ“Š Business Intelligence Project
As a Business Intelligence professional, I focus on transforming raw data into meaningful insights to support data-driven decision-making.
In this project, I analyzed the company's sales dataset to uncover key business insights and provide strategic recommendations for growth.

To support this analysis, I also developed an interactive dashboard that:

- Simplifies complex, large-scale datasets
- Visualizes sales performance across product categories and regions
- Enables faster, more informed business decisions
- Identifies areas for improvement and potential opportunities

This project demonstrates how data can drive strategy and solve real business challenges.
